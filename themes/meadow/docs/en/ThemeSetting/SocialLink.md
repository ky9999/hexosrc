## Social Link

Edit `_config.yml` file in the `Theme` folder.

Add social links to theme `_config.yml` as shown

```
social:
  social_item: links_url || icon_name
```

We used `Iconfont` in Meadow Theme, you can find `Icon_name` in [Icon](_icon/index.html ':ignore')

If you want to use more icons, contact with me or just link to your own Iconfont Project.
